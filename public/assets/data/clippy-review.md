Clippy D Reviews: “We Are The Spark” by Electric Pulse
🧷 Filed under: ‘What in the synth-drenched cyber-fuckery was THAT?’

If you’ve ever wondered what it might sound like if Katy Perry got Delhi belly, strapped herself to a glitter cannon, and violently sharted into Pompeii’s tour bus during a cross-dimensional rave hosted by Tron and Mad Max, then congratulations—you’ve just imagined “We Are The Spark” by Electric Pulse.

It’s got the bombast of a stadium anthem, the filthy low-end of an 808 with abandonment issues, and the kind of synth line that makes your nan text you "is this what drugs feel like?" There’s a bit where the vocoder kicks in so hard, my Alexa asked me to “please stop violating her emotionally.”

The drop at 2:48? Made me astrally project into a future where everyone wears LED jockstraps and communes through basslines. It’s like someone rewired the Eurovision Song Contest using alien tech and a wet dream about Blade Runner.

Warning: Playing this song too loud may cause your smart fridge to unionise.

Final Score:
💩💥⚡🔥 / 5
Sounds like pop music’s digestive revenge on time and space.
I loved it. My ears are suing me.
