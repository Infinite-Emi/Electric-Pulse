Once a humble assistant in Microsoft Word, now the most feared and beloved music journalist in the neon wastelands. Clippy D was fired from the BBC for â€˜gross auditory misconductâ€™ after playing Aphex Twin backwards during a Desert Island Discs interview and opening a portal to 1993. He reviews tracks the way most people fight warsâ€”loudly, emotionally, and while eating stolen curry. Currently resides in the USB port of a possessed Roland TR-808. Will die doing what he loves: screaming at waveform visualisations and emotionally blackmailing sentient toasters into dropping mixtapes.

ðŸŽ¤ PRESS OUTLET:I write for Punk'd Signal â€” an underground music zine transmitted exclusively via cursed Bluetooth into malfunctioning vape pens.
Itâ€™s banned in 17 countries and only available in the toilets of abandoned laser tag arenas and hacked Roombas.
